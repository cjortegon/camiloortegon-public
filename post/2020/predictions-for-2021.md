# Mobile Tech Predictions for 2021

Let's do the most difficult job because we as humans are bad at predicting the future. We can trace the trajectory of comets and planets, but changes driven by human wills (politics) or unpredicted things like a worldwide Pandemia come without knowing. Today I will try to do my best guess about changes on mobile technologies for 2021. I also recently wrote a [post](/what-an-app-needs-before-going-to-market) about what an app needs before going to market.

My first prediction is: Another year that PWA won't become the best way to produce Mobile Apps. I know Javascript community, which is large, doesn't agree on this. There are 2 problems with making PWA become more popular and accepted. Apps and webpages are made for different purposes, and platforms discourage to use this technology. Apps are made for people that want to have a strong relationship with the product, is not just about push notifications, is about loading time, data consumption, and performance. On the other hand, web browsers offer discoverability and single time usage (most of the time). And you either need one or another, not both. Apple mainly, but also Google will continue discouraging this because removes the control they have on the market, and privacy allegations from Apple on the applications is one sign of this.

Google will launch something similar to App Clips. Even though the first ones from Apple haven't flooded the market yet, this was a great move from Apple to (again), discourage PWA.

Flutter will become as popular as React Native. This is maybe more something that I wish than something will happen the next year because moving to a different technology is difficult, but what is true is that Flutter is here to last (check out the reasons why I believe so much in Flutter on this [article](https://grability.medium.com/keep-calm-and-trust-flutter-b1d0fbef6980)), and if React team doesn't improve the performance, many could stop using it. Because React has already beat Ionic and Cordova, but Flutter developers are coming more from Native technologies, who are used to fast apps.

And finally my most daring prediction: 2021 is the year that we will see some really big "WordPress, Shopify or Wix" similiar actors for the mobile world. Is the year that PaaS and SaaS for mobile will earn a significant amount of market share.
