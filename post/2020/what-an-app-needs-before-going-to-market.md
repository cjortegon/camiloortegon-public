# What an app needs before going to market

If you reach this point is because you have an incredible business idea and you have already decided that you should create an app for it. If you have not yet validated your business model, first think that other 7 billion people in the world could have came up with another solution, and if it does not exist yet (check that first), could be for timing: availability of technology or cultural matters. But also see if before an app, you should better develop a web page.

A good way to know if a web page is better could be to ask yourself if the people who use it are really going to access it from the street, or if they will prefer to connect from their homes. Keep in mind that people prefer to put their credit cards from a computer and much better if they can do it from well-known portals such as PayU Latam or PayPal. And if you find that a webpage also solves that particular need, because we also use the mobile web browser, think if an Instagram profile with one Whatsapp button can work better for your future clients.

10 years ago we created apps where you could control all the content that the user could access, and the user even paid to unlock new features. 6 years ago a successful app should allow the user to decide on the content they wanted to consume, the level of personalization increased, being able to share or create an account became a "must have" in most apps and services even became popular rendered through apps. Today we are reaching a point where it imperious to know our users to give them a custom experience, making the app learn from each interaction.

A fundamental matter today is the user interface, making a good first impression today is more important than ever, so it is worth spending a good time on this. An app must have a main purpose and it must fulfill it. It is the characteristic that justifies the existence of your app. Many times when we think of an idea we try to add more and more features, but this just takes us away from the reason why someone will download it.

Think that we all are saturated with the hundreds of promotions received by mail or phone, offering form part of XYZ community. This is why the traffic attracted by e-mail has fell to less than a third in recent years. Think that the space on our phones is still very precious and we are not going to waste it on something that we can already do with another app.

The monetization model is essential before thinking about any other feature. The most popular (and it is important to choose 1 or a maximum of 2) are: Payed apps, recurring services, freemium model, or by adding ads. Subscription model has grow a lot for many apps recently. Freemium is the clasic way to give some functions for free while advanced features are payed. And Ads market, although has reduce the payment per impresion through time, next year will have important changes because of the privacy demands for users and platforms like Apple Store.

Today there are no excuses for not having Analytics from day 1 and filling a simple privacy policy is important today even for the most simple apps.

Other thumb rules for today's market are: not abusing of notifications wich can lead to uninstalls. Many apps are suspended or demonetized, in the case of using bad Ads platforms if we don't comply with all the legal and platform terms.

As I have explained before, having a login is more and more important, I recommend you read these tips to have an ["Effective Smooth Sign-up"](/blog/2019/cinco-consejos-para-tener-un-smooth-signup-efectivo) (Spanish). To avoid bad ratings in stores, it is advisable to put a feedback link that allows users to write you an email.

As we will don't have all the time to develop at first release the full features, there are 2 strategies to overcome these difficulties:

1. Using dummies buttons, which warn the user that this is a feature under development. And thanks to Analytics we can collect how many users want this feature to be developed.

2. A second strategy is to use open fields where users can ask for what they need. Two examples of this are: the beginnings of Booking that, before offering specific tourism plans, left the user to choose how much money they wanted to spend. And more recently Rappi, which since its launch added the option "Whatever you want" to find out what its customers needs based on a simple chat.
